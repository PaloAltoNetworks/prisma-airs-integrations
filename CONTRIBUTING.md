## 📁 Integration Template Structure

When adding a new integration, follow this structure:

```
PlatformName/
├── README.md                 # Main integration guide
├── config/                   # Optional: Configuration files
│   ├── example-config.yaml
│   └── example-settings.json
├── scripts/                  # Optional: Setup/deployment scripts
│   └── setup.sh
└── examples/                 # Optional: Working examples
    └── sample-request.json
```

### README.md Template

---

## Configuration Steps

### Step 1: [First Major Step]

Clear, numbered instructions...

### Step 2: [Second Major Step]

More instructions with code examples...

```yaml
# Example configuration
key: value
```

## ✅ Quality Guidelines

### Documentation
- **Clarity**: Write for users who may be unfamiliar with the platform
- **Completeness**: Include all required steps and prerequisites
- **Accuracy**: Test all instructions before submitting
- **Formatting**: Use consistent markdown formatting
- **Links**: Verify all URLs and cross-references work

### Code Examples
- **Working**: All code samples must be tested and functional
- **Commented**: Include inline comments explaining complex sections
- **Secure**: Never include actual API keys or credentials
- **Current**: Use current API versions and best practices

### Configuration Files
- **Templates**: Provide example configurations with placeholder values
- **Validation**: Ensure configurations are syntactically correct
- **Documentation**: Comment complex configuration options

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Never commit real credentials** - Use placeholders like `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`
- **Sanitize examples** - Remove any production data from examples
- **Review security impact** - Consider security implications of configurations
- **Follow least privilege** - Recommend minimal required permissions

## 🧪 Testing Your Changes

Before submitting:

1. **Spell check** - Run a spell checker on documentation
2. **Link validation** - Verify all links are accessible
3. **Code testing** - Test all code examples in a clean environment
4. **Markdown rendering** - Preview how your markdown renders on GitHub

## 📝 Commit Message Guidelines

Follow conventional commit format:

- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `feat:` - New integration or feature
- `fix:` - Bug fixes or corrections
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks
- `test:` - Adding tests or examples

Examples:
```
